# bots-paper-repo
Anonymous repo for a paper in submission to CSCW 2018.

## Datasets
### Data dumps
This project begins with the the stub-meta-history.xml.gz dumps from the Wikimedia foundation. Note that these files are large -- approximately 85GB compressed.

### Revert datasets
Datasets in `datasets/revert_data/` are every bot-bot revert for each language, generated from parsing the dumps by the scripts called in the `Makefile`. They are compressed using bzip2 and in TSV format. The format of these datasets can be seen in `analysis/0-load-process-data.ipynb`. These datasets in this repo let you reproduce our analysis, if you don't want to download the raw dumps.

### Processed datasets
Datasets in `datasets/processed_data/` are created out of the analyses in the Jupyter notebooks in the `analysis/` folder. If you want to conduct further analysis, we'd recommend starting with `df_all_comments_parsed_2016.pickle.xz`. These datasets are compressed with xz (extremely compressed to keep them under GitHub's 100mb limit -- we will release many more common data formats when we can de-anonymize and use other platforms). The decompressed pickle file is a serialized pandas dataframe that can be loaded in python, as seen in the notebooks in the `analysis/paper_plots` folder.

- `df_all_2016.pickle.xz` is a pandas dataframe of all bot-bot reverts in the languages in our dataset. It is generated by running the Jupyter notebook `analysis/0-load-process-data.ipynb`, which also shows the variables in this dataset.

- `df_all_comments_parsed_2016.pickle.xz` extends `df_all_2016.pickle.xz` with classifications of reverts. It is generated by `analysis/6-1-comment-parsing.ipynb`, which also shows the variables in this dataset.

- `possible_botfights.pickle.bz2` and `possible_botfights.tsv.bz2` are bzip2-compressed filtered datasets of `df_all_comments_parsed_2016.pickle`, containing reverts from all langauges in our analysis that are possible cases of bot-bot conflict. 

## Analyses
### Analyses in the paper
Analyses that are presented in the paper are in the `analysis/paper_plots` folder, with Jupyter notebooks for each paper section (for example, section 4.2 on time to revert is presented in 4-2-time-to-revert.ipynb). Some of these notebooks include more plots than we were able to fit in the paper.
### Exploratory analyses
We also have various supplemental and exploratory analyses in `analyses/exploratory/`.
